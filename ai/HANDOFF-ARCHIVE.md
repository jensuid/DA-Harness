The archive of `ai/HANDOFF.md`'s `## Next action` sections. Each section is
moved here verbatim, never edited or summarised, when the task that wrote it
completes - it is the record of what a session knew and why it chose what it
chose. Reading this is not part of resuming; `ai/HANDOFF.md` is.

## Next action

**W2X-012 phase A landed: the LLM degradation is no longer silent.** The
walk-test's BLOCKER had two halves - a credential that never reaches the
packaged app, and an analyst who was told nothing about it - and this session
closed the second. `server/app/llm.py` is the one place the three env vars the
six adapters each read for themselves get read for an answer, `GET
/llm/status` carries it (configured, the provider *name*, the model and base
URL, never the key), the core writes one boot line about which engine is in
play, and `LlmStatusBanner` renders on every screen: nothing when an LLM is
configured, because a green banner on every screen is noise the analyst learns
to dismiss, and a concern banner naming the deterministic engines when one is
not. Both states were verified against a real browser with the core started
both ways.

**The finding is not gone, only honest now.** The credential still does not
reach `/Applications/DAH.app` - `.env` is gitignored and un-bundled, `main.py`
loads it relative to a path that does not exist inside a PyInstaller bundle,
and the shell does not inject the key. That is phase B, and it needs a design
decision before code: a first-run UI prompt writing into the app data dir (the
recommendation, and the one the status surface is built to pre-fill), or
build-time secret injection into the bundle (works today, burns the key into a
binary that can be reversed). Phase A is the floor either of them builds on -
without a way to ask the core what it has, phase B's own UI cannot tell the
analyst whether it worked.

**Gates:** server 741 (728 + 13), web 223 (216 + 7), tsc clean, build ok
(CSS 16.84 kB, JS 744 kB), trace 48/48, e2e 28/28, golden 21/21, refine AT-04
(100/100/0/0), measure 9/9.

**Next, in priority order:**

1. **W2X-012 phase B - the design decision, then the settings surface.** A
   first-run prompt plus a "DAH Settings…" menu item writing
   `DAH_LLM_*` into the app data dir and telling the core where to read
   them, with the banner now able to say "configured" the moment it works.
   The shell gains a Tauri command (a capability change - `core:default`
   grants nothing today, and that permission set is a deliberate property)
   and the core gains a read path for the data-dir file, so this is two or
   three commits, not one.
2. **W2X-007 + W2X-006, the analysis editor** - one surface: an editable
   textarea replacing the `<pre>` the generated code shows, posting to the
   endpoints that already exist. The realest frustration loop in the
   walk-test.
3. **W2X-002 and W2X-005** - an inline required-field message and a real
   action instead of the raw `POST` endpoint string. Both small.
4. **W2X-008, the density.** The largest effort and the original complaint:
   hide empty panels, collapse completed stages, narrow the orientation zone.
5. **W2X-001, W2X-009, then the five MINORs.**

**Two carried decisions stay, both unchanged and both not code:** the
packaged app is unsigned by DEC-006, and GitHub Actions' billing is
suspended (fix at Settings > Billing & plans; nothing since `c73118c` has
run in CI).
