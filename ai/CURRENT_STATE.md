# DAH - Current State

 - **Phase:** P4 Production Candidate - COMPLETE (all 5 checklist items:
  P4-VERIFY-001, P4-RELIABILITY-002, P4-UX-003 + P4-UX-004, P4-VALID-005,
  P4-PERF-006, P4-CI-007). P3 V1 is COMPLETE: all 10 entry-checklist items,
  231 server tests, and a P3 gate of its own. P5 Production Grade is IN
  PROGRESS (4 of 5 checklist items: the P4 gate, observability, the 500
  envelope and release automation are done; only signing remains, and it is
  blocked on the Apple Developer ID).
- **Global roadmap status:** ai/ROADMAP.md (phase tracker - current stage, phase table, next-phase entry checklist)
- **Milestone status:** P1 Vertical Slice PASSED (verification/p1/REPORT.md); P0 PASSED
- **Completed capabilities:** FastAPI core; SQLite case persistence; DuckDB engine; Vite/React shell; P0 verification harness; CSV dataset attachment; deterministic dataset profiling; read-only SQL analysis runs with persisted results; findings with evidence chain; validation via rerun; parquet + xlsx ingest; deep profiling; **read-only Python execution with persisted results (P2-ANALYSIS-008); chart images rendered and persisted from run results (P2-ANALYSIS-009);
case management - rename, duplicate, delete (P2-CASE-010);
AI planning with structured output (P2-AI-011); case export as a self-contained
JSON package with import round trip (P2-CASE-012)**
- **Active task:** P5-UX-006 DONE - a "Reveal DAH Logs" menu item. The core
  answers `GET /logs` with a path, but a path in a JSON body is a terminal
  answer, and the shell exists because this user does not have a terminal. New
  `desktop/src-tauri/src/logs.rs` is the bridge: it asks the core, then hands
  the answer to Finder with `open -R` (macOS-native, no new dependency -
  serde_json is the only addition and it is already in the tree through tauri).
  Everything degrades to a sentence: a core still booting, hung, or older than
  the endpoint is "logging is off", and a body that is not the expected shape
  cannot panic a menu. main.rs gets a real macOS menu bar - the app menu keeps
  About and Cmd+Q, which setting any custom menu takes away, Edit keeps the
  text editing a data tool needs, and DAH > Reveal DAH Logs is the one item DAH
  adds. 5 new Rust tests (12 total, was 7), including an e2e test that starts
  the real dev core and asserts the reported log is under the data dir the
  shell pointed it at. Before it: P5-RELEASE-005, release automation.
- **Known issues:** CI's runner is `macos-latest`, not the Ventura/Intel pin
  P5-CI-004 intended - GitHub retired the macos-13 pool, so the label hangs
  forever (probed empirically; see DEC-005). The Ventura floor stays the
  documented minimum but is no longer enforced by CI, and a green run no longer
  proves the exact Intel triple a local build produces. Restoring that needs a
  self-hosted Intel runner.
- **Test status:** server 256 passed (211 + 16 error semantics + 2 validation
  determinism + 6 large-dataset + 21 observability); web 17 passed (CaseList 5, CaseCreation 3,
  CaseWorkspace 9);
  desktop shell 7 Rust tests (5 unit + 2 e2e, `cd desktop/src-tauri && cargo test [--features e2e]`);
  P2 and P3 gates PASS; first release v0.1.0 published from tag and checksum-verified
- **Next task:** P5-CI-FIX-007 is done (CI green for the first time since ae0ba33, and v0.1.0 published). The last P5 checklist item remains macOS signing + notarization,
  formally deferred by DEC-004 and **blocked on an external dependency only you
  can provision** - a $99 Apple Developer ID. The release job already has the
  slot: signing goes between the build and the upload, and the `--prerelease`
  flag is what to revisit once a build is notarized. Not agent work until the ID
  exists. Everything else unblocked is smaller: an arm64 release lane (a second
  runner and sidecar triple, unverifiable on this x86_64 machine except by CI
  itself), a "Reveal logs" menu item in the desktop shell calling `GET /logs`,
  and showing the request id's full value somewhere copyable - the one item
  still open from the follow-up list.
  Carried: a 500 still answers with Starlette's plain-text "Internal Server
  Error"; the client handles it, but a JSON envelope is the last rough edge of
  the error contract.
- **Blockers:** none

## Platform decisions (locked, see ai/DECISIONS.md)

- Backend: Python + FastAPI
- Case state: SQLite
- Analytical engine: DuckDB (analytical queries only)
- Frontend: React + Vite (browser-served; Tauri wraps the same bundle post-MVP)
- Frontend never touches filesystem or DuckDB directly - API only

## How to run

- Server: `cd server && .venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8123`
- Server tests: `cd server && .venv/bin/python -m pytest`
- Web dev: `cd web && npm run dev` (proxies /api to :8123)
- Web build: `cd web && npm run build`
- Desktop shell, dev (serves the embedded bundle): `cd desktop && npm install && npm run dev`
- Desktop shell, HMR (vite dev server, pinned to port 5273): `cd desktop && npm run dev:hmr`
- Desktop shell, packaged app: `cd server && ./build_sidecar.sh && cd ../desktop && npm run build`
- Desktop shell tests: `cd desktop/src-tauri && cargo test --features e2e`
- Web tests: `cd web && npm test`
- P0 verification: `python3 verification/p0/verify_p0.py` (needs port bind)
- P1 verification: `server/.venv/bin/python verification/p1/verify_p1.py` (in-process)
- P2 verification: `server/.venv/bin/python verification/p2/verify_p2.py` (in-process)
- Python analysis run: `POST /cases/{id}/datasets/{id}/runs/python` with `{"code": "..."}`
- Delete a dataset: `DELETE /cases/{id}/datasets/{id}` (removes the row, profile, plans and file; 400 while a run still binds it)
- Export: `GET /cases/{id}/export` (self-contained JSON package); `POST /cases/import`
  reconstructs it with fresh IDs
- Plan: `POST /cases/{id}/datasets/{id}/plan` (structured plan from question + profile; deterministic by default, LLM when DAH_LLM_API_KEY is set, source field records which); latest at `GET .../plan`, history at `GET .../plans`
- Search cases: `GET /cases?q=<term>` (case-insensitive substring over question and dataset; blank lists all)
- Case timeline: `GET /cases/{id}/history` (one event per artifact, chronological)
- Templates: `POST /cases/{id}/template` with `{"name"?}` (promote), `GET /templates`,
  `POST /cases/from-template` with `{"template_id", "question"?, "dataset"?}`,
  `DELETE /templates/{id}` (templates outlive their source case)
- Interpret a run: `POST /cases/{id}/runs/{id}/interpret` (plain-language read of the result; deterministic by default, LLM when DAH_LLM_API_KEY is set, `source` records which); latest at `GET .../interpret`, history at `GET .../interpretations`
- Draft a finding: `POST /cases/{id}/runs/{id}/draft-finding` (the candidate finding a result supports - statement, interpretation, caveat and grounds; deterministic by default, LLM when DAH_LLM_API_KEY is set, `source` records which; **writes nothing** - accepting a draft is a POST to `/cases/{id}/findings`, the only path that creates one)
- Generate code: `POST /cases/{id}/datasets/{id}/generate-code` with `{question, kind?: "sql"|"python"}` (the read-only computation a question needs - code, explanation, the columns it reads; deterministic by default, LLM when DAH_LLM_API_KEY is set, `source` records which; **writes nothing** - running a proposal is a POST to the `/runs` or `/runs/python` endpoint)
- Ask the case: `POST /cases/{id}/chat` with `{message}` (an answer grounded in the case's own artifacts, citing each claim in `grounds` as `kind:name`; deterministic by default, LLM when DAH_LLM_API_KEY is set, `source` records which); the whole conversation at `GET /cases/{id}/chat` oldest-first
- Chart from a run: `POST /cases/{id}/runs/{id}/charts` with `{"kind": "bar|line", "x": ..., "y": ..., "series": ...}`; image at `GET /cases/{id}/charts/{id}/image`
- Rename: `PATCH /cases/{id}` with `{question?, dataset?}`; duplicate: `POST /cases/{id}/duplicate`;
  delete: `DELETE /cases/{id}` (removes the case row, all children, and its on-disk data)

## P4 progress

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| P4-VERIFY-001 P3 gate script | DONE |
| P4-RELIABILITY-002 error semantics | DONE |
| P4-UX-003 case workspace + chat | DONE |
| P4-UX-004 run-scoped assistant surfaces | DONE |
| P4-VALID-005 validation rerun determinism | DONE |
| P4-PERF-006 large-dataset performance | DONE |
| P4-CI-007 CI + signing decision | DONE |

## How to run (P4)

- P3 verification: `server/.venv/bin/python verification/p3/verify_p3.py`
  (in-process, ~3-4 min; the last step re-runs the suite)

## How to run (web)

- Web tests: `cd web && npm test` (17 tests; vitest, jsdom, no network)
- Web build: `cd web && npm run build` (tsc -b + vite)
- Desktop bundle: `cd web && npm run build:desktop` (absolute API URL for the
  Tauri shell)
- Note for live checks: a background process started from a shell here does not
  outlive its command session - run uvicorn/vite in a persistent session, or
  the smoke test dies with ECONNREFUSED mid-run.
